## A Note on Products

Since flow trading is trade-over-time, it stands to reason that the products
being traded might also change over time. In particular, for a forward market,
as real-time approaches a product may be "refined" into smaller delivery
intervals. That is, a monthly product is refined into daily products, and these
daily products into hourly products.

A daily product is implicitly a portfolio of its hourly products. Thus, a flow
trading implementation is more than capable of handling these dynamic partition
events without requiring a bidder to create a new auth in the finer product basis.

Our reference implementation does precisely this, allowing one to specify a "parent"
product when creating a new product, along with a conversion ratio. (Depending on the
application, this ratio is likely either `1.0` or `new duration / old duration`.)

The server auth endpoints allow for querying the original specified portfolio definition
as well as the dynamic, implicit definition (on the finest basis of products available).
