title: Auths
description: Understanding auths in flow trading
---

In a flow trading market, bidders create submissions out of various bid
primitives. There are only two such primitives: an *auth* and a *cost*.
This guide provides an explanation for the former.

## What is an Auth?

An auth, short for "authorization", is an explicit definition of a *portfolio* of products
and a demand curve to express willingness-to-trade.

## What is a Portfolio?

In flow trading, products are not traded
directly. Rather, each bidder defines portfolios of products, then trade these portfolios in
strict, proportional accordance with the weights in the portfolio.

Suppose a market contains products `A` and `B` (among others). The following are all examples of portfolios:
```typescript
// A "singleton" portfolio that trades only A
P1 = { A: 1.0 }
// A portfolio that trades both A and B **in equal amounts**
P2 = { A: 1.0, B: 1.0 }
// A portfolio that replaces A with B (or vice versa)
P3 = { A: 0.5, B: -0.75 }
```

There are no restrictions on the signs or magnitudes of the weights. Buying 1
unit of a portfolio will buy 1 times the associated weight for each underlying
product; selling 1 unit will do the same. Flow trading assumes the unifying
convention of buying as positive demand and selling as negative demand. Thus,
buying 4 units of `P3` corresponds to buying 2 units of `A` and selling 3 units
of `B`.

## What is a demand curve?

A demand curve is a weakly monotone decreasing function `r(p)` which expresses a desired rate of trade as a function of price.
All auths must specify a demand curve for the associated portfolio. There are two ways to specify this function:
either as a list of points, defining a piecewise linear function, or as an object declaring a minimum and maximum rate and a constant price.

We saw examples of both in the [Simple Trading Session](/guides/simple-trading-session/):
```typescript
// An example with a piecewise-linear definition of a demand curve
{
	"portfolio": { "EXAMPLE_PRODUCT": 1 },
	"data": {
		"demand": [{ "rate": 0, "price": 15 }, { "rate": 20, "price": 5 }]
	}
}
```
and
```typescript
// An example with a constant-price definition of a demand curve
{
	"portfolio": { "EXAMPLE_PRODUCT": 1 },
	"data": {
		"demand": { "max_rate": 0, "price": 10 }
	}
}
```

In the second example, notice that while the `max_rate` is set to `0`, there is no `min_rate`.
This demand curve can only *sell* the portfolio. In the first example, though it uses the piecewise-linear specification,
this curve admits only non-negative rates in its range, so it can only *buy* the portfolio.

The only restriction on the demand curve is that `rate = 0` must exist within its range.

## Summary

In flow trading, products are not directly bid upon. Instead, each bidder authorizes trade on strictly-weighted portfolios of products.
An auth is this pair: the portfolio and a demand curve that both constrains the feasible trade as well as expresses preferences over outcomes.
Costs (discussed next) are a generalization of auths, allowing for substitution effects to take place over related portfolios.
