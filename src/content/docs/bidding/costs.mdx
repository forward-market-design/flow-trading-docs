title: Costs
description: Understanding costs in flow trading
---

In a flow trading market, bidders create submissions out of various bid
primitives. There are only two such primitives: an *auth* and a *cost*.
This guide provides an explanation for the latter.

## What is a Cost?

A cost is an explicit definition of a *group* of auths alongside a demand curve.
Collectively, the costs measure the utility for any potential trade outcome. Thus,
costs permit [the core optimization](/advanced/optimization) to find an outcome that
maximizes social welfare (gains from trade) within the set of feasible trades.

## What is a Group?

The [flow trading paper](https://cramton.umd.edu/papers2020-2024/budish-cramton-kyle-lee-malec-flow-trading.pdf)
pairs a demand curve directly to a portfolio, so the distinct separation between an auth and a cost is not present
in the paper. In developing the reference server, it was found formally separating the two provided
some advantages in the software implementation as well as enabled additional flexibility in the bid language.

This flexibility relates to *substitution*: when a group consists of a single auth with weight 1, the associated demand curve
controls the rate of trade of the auth directly. If the group instead consists of two auths each with weight 1, then the optimization
gains a degree of freedom to mix-and-match the two auths in a way that maximizes gains from trade. If the two auths are not perfect substitutes,
they can have different coefficients (even potentially of mixed signs).

Superficially (but not semantically), groups look a lot like portfolios, but with auth ids keyed to weights instead of product ids. For example, supposing the bidder has defined auths A1 and A2,
the following are all valid groups:
```typescript
// A "singleton" group that directly prices A1
G1 = { A1: 1.0 }
// A "substitution" group that treats A1 and A2 as perfect substitutes
G2 = { A1: 1.0, A2: 1.0 }
// An otherwise perfectly valid group
G3 = { A1: 0.5, A2: -0.75 }
```

## How is Utility Specified?

Utility is specified via a demand curve, with the usual convention of positive and negative rates corresponding to buying and selling.
Demand curves must be non-increasing and must have a domain permitting zero trade.

The reference implementation accepts two ways to specify a demand curve.

### Piecewise-Linear Demand Curve

The first and primary way to specify a demand curve is via a list of points, which are interpreted to correspond to a piecewise linear curve. A simple example is:
```typescript
type PWLDemandCurve = { "rate": number, "price": number }[]
```
This list may contain arbitrarily many elements; as mentioned, the only restrictions are
1. `FirstPoint.rate <= 0 <= LastPoint.rate`
2. For each point `P[i]`, `P[i].rate <= P[i+1].rate` and `P[i].price >= P[i+1].price`.

Note that this permits "flat" segments on the demand curve. While this is permissable as far as the optimization is concerned,
there may be a desire for a market operator to impose a validity requirement of having a minimum slope. The reference
flow trading server does not impose such a requirement, but a market operator is encouraged to enforce such a restriction on their
systems before forwarding a submission to the server.

### Constant Demand Curve

The second approach to specifying a demand curve assumes a constant price, allowing for a potentially infinite domain. As before, the market operator
might wish to restrict this type of specification in order to enforce a minimum slope, but the reference server does not require
this. The constant demand curve is specified as a triplet of (min_rate, max_rate, price):
```typescript
type ConstantDemandCurve = { min_rate?: number | null, max_rate?: number | null, price: number }
```
If the min and max rates are omitted or set to null, they will be implicitly assigned a value of negative and positive infinity respectively.


## A Note on Auths

Costs assign utility to potential trade outcomes constained by the auths.
Because this utility is additive, there is no distinction between "no costs"
and a "cost of zero". Thus, in the pathological scenario where an auth has been
defined but no cost references it, without intervention the optimization would
assume that all possible trades of this auth are equally preferable and actually
have no cost to the bidder. This can happen naturally when a bidder creates a new
auth to replace an existing one with a slightly different portfolio, but neglects
to replace the cost that references the old auth.

Use of the atomic `/v0/submissions/{bidder_id}` endpoint can help here. Additionally,
the reference implementation chooses to implicitly constrain an auth to zero trade if
no cost group references it. If the bidder actually desires to treat the auth as having
zero cost, they can simply make this desire explicit by defining such a cost with `price = 0`.


## Summary

Costs assign utility to groups of auths, allowing for optimization to select an outcome that maximizes gains from trade and social welfare.
This outcome will be constrained by the feasible trade regions defined by the auths and the domains of the demand curves defined in the cost.
