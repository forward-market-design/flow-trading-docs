description: Understanding costs in flow trading
---

In a flow trading market, bidders create submissions out of various bid
primitives. There are only two such primitives: an *auth* and a *cost*.
This guide provides an explanation for the latter.

## What is a Cost?

A cost is an explicit definition of a *group* of auths alongside a demand curve.
Collectively, the costs measure the utility for any potential trade outcome. Thus,
permit [the core optimization](/advanced/optimization) to find an outcome that
maximizes social welfare (gains from trade) within the set of feasible trades.

## What is a Group?

The [flow trading paper](https://cramton.umd.edu/papers2020-2024/budish-cramton-kyle-lee-malec-flow-trading.pdf)
pairs a demand curve directly to a portfolio, while this implementation introduces one layer of separation. This
layer of separation allows for *substitution* effects between portfolios. That is, there might be different products
that are "close enough" to one another that a bidder might be indifferent between them (up to some scaling). A group
allows a bidder to specify this indifference
