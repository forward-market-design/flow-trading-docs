This guide will walk you through downloading, compiling, and running a flow trading server. Basic familiarity with a command-line, bash-like shell is assumed.

## Setup

This guide assumes that the reader has both CMake and Rust >= 1.8.5 installed on their computer.

* CMake can be [downloaded directly](https://cmake.org/download/) or installed via your system's packaging utility, e.g. `brew install cmake` or `apt-get install cmake`.
* Rust can be installed via [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

If both	`which cmake` and `which cargo` return a path, your system is ready for the next step.

## Downloading and Installing

The demonstration server is available directly from [crates.io](https://crates.io), or can be built from source [cloning our repository](https://github.com/forward-market-design/flow-trading-service).

### Option 1: Install Directly
The following command will download and compile the latest release of the flow trading demonstration server:
```bash
cargo install fts-demo
```

### Option 2: Build from Repository
```bash
# Clone the repository if necessary
git clone https://github.com/forward-market-design/flow-trading-service.git
cd flow-trading-service

# Compile and run the demonstration server
cargo build --release --bin fts-demo
```

<Aside type="note">
The rest of this guide assumes `fts-demo` is directly available in your system path. If you build from source, you will need to explicitly refer to the binary target, e.g. replace `fts-demo` with `./target/release/fts-demo`.
</Aside>

## Running the Server

Either option above will download the project dependencies and build the software. To launch a server, run
```bash
fts-demo --api-secret SECRET --trade-rate 1h
```

This run the server on the default port 8080. The OpenAPI schema can be explored at http://localhost:8080/rapidoc if the server is successfully running. A Dockerfile is also available to build and run the binary.
<Aside type="caution">
The API is under active development and this OpenAPI schema file is not yet suitable for automated client-generation pipelines.
</Aside>


The available configuration options are available via	`fts-demo --help` and are discussed in the [project README](https://github.com/forward-market-design/flow-trading-service/blob/main/fts-demo/README.md#configuration). 

## Next Steps

It is recommended to walkthrough a [simple trading session](/guides/simple-trading-session) to gain basic familiarity with the server architecture and a high-level understanding of the bid language.
