title: Simple Trading Session
description: Interact with a running flow trading server
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide will walk you through a simple trading session. It will be assumed
that a flow trading server is running locally
(refer to the [Quick Start](/guides/quick-start) guide if necessary)
and that `curl`, `date`, and `jq` commands are available in your system path.

By the end of this guide, you will have learned to generate and submit bids and
gained a basic understanding of working with a flow-trading based marketplace.

## Setup

The demonstration flow trading server assumes that valid bidders possess a
cryptographically-signed token attesting their identity, known as a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io).
This allows the flow trading server to defer the complexity of user management
and authenticaton to external systems controlled by the market operator.

<Aside type="caution">
For the purposes of this guide, the background flow trading server will be assumed
to have launched with `---api-secret SECRET`. The examples below will not work
if the secret is any other value.
</Aside>

Accordingly, we will need to generate these tokens for our trading session.
Copy and paste the below variables into your `bash` or `zsh` session:
```bash
# Change this to the location of your server, if different
API_SERVER=http://localhost:8080
# Signed JWT for user 11111111-1111-8111-8111-111111111111
JWTB1=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMTExMTExMS0xMTExLTgxMTEtODExMS0xMTExMTExMTExMTEifQ.jIy_I8E-VW1ToODyVzqU6dLrLaXKnbFGDvbqTs4N-Jo
# Signed JWT for user 22222222-2222-8222-8222-222222222222
JWTB2=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIyMjIyMjIyMi0yMjIyLTgyMjItODIyMi0yMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIifQ.4x0mSmuS9s9CnMOYhjTd8WPB2ZUo0P3V0ak5Mdc0W1c
# Signed JWT for an admin user
JWTADMIN=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJGRkZGRkZGRi1GRkZGLUZGRkYtRkZGRi1GRkZGRkZGRkZGRkYiLCJhZG1pbiI6dHJ1ZX0.CV3aldMRLqaRY2UsKYxFpC-tWI8EbJoXl7YlF4gYcjY
```

<Aside type="note">
Notice that bidder ids are simply [UUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).
In fact, the decoded JWT tokens above correspond to `{ sub: <BIDDER_ID> }`. (The admin token also includes a custom claim `admin: true`.)
</Aside>

## Product Definition

Before engaging in trading, the market must define *products* to be traded.
Using our admin token, we can define a list of products and get back their
server-generated IDs for later use. Copy and paste the below to create a single
product and store its ID in the environment variable `PRODUCT`.
```bash
PRODUCT=$(\
  curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWTADMIN" \
    --data '[{ "kind": "DEMO", "from": "2030-01-01T00:00:00Z", "thru": "2030-01-01T06:00:00Z" }]' \
    $API_SERVER/admin/products \
  | jq -r '.[0]' \
)
```

The demonstration server defines products via a triplet `(type, from, thru)`,
which is suitable for trading in a forward market where products are primarily
characterized by their delivery window. One can imagine defining products for
every hour of every day of every year.

## Submissions

A bidder has at most one submission, which is comprised of *auths* and *costs*.
We will keep things simple and define a single auth that trades the single product
without restriction. We will also assign a cost to this auth that expresses
the *piecewise-linear, non-increasing* demand for the underlying products. The
server takes the unifying convention of positive demand corresponding to buying
and negative demand to selling.

```bash
curl -s -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWTB1" \
  --data '{
    "auths": [{
      "auth_id": "11111111-AAAA-8111-8111-111111111111",
      "portfolio": { "'"$PRODUCT"'": 1 },
      "data": {}
    }],
    "costs": [{
      "cost_id": "11111111-CCCC-8111-8111-111111111111",
      "group": { "11111111-AAAA-8111-8111-111111111111": 1 },
      "data": [{ "rate": 0, "price": 15 }, { "rate": 20, "price": 5 }]
    }]
  }' $API_SERVER/v0/submissions/11111111-1111-8111-8111-111111111111 | jq . 
```

The server will echo the submission back if was successfully parsed and accepted.

We also define a submission for the other bidder, selling the same product:

```bash
curl -s -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWTB2" \
   --data '{
    "auths": [{
      "auth_id": "22222222-AAAA-8222-8222-222222222222",
      "portfolio": { "'"$PRODUCT"'": 1 },
      "data": {}
    }],
    "costs": [{
        "cost_id": "22222222-CCCC-8222-8222-222222222222",
        "group": { "22222222-AAAA-8222-8222-222222222222": 1 },
        "data": { "max_rate": 0, "price": 10 }
    }]
  }' $API_SERVER/v0/submissions/22222222-2222-8222-8222-222222222222 | jq . 
```

Here we used an alternate specification of the cost, restricting the trade to nonpositive rates.


<Aside type="note">
The respective pages on [auths](/concepts/auths)
and [costs](/concepts/costs) provide details on
how they relate to specific outcomes a bidder might seek to achieve.
Their full definition ties deeply into the underlying mathematics
of flow trading so this discussion is best saved for later.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
The `/v0/submissions/{bidder_id}` endpoint is actually an atomic wrapper
around the individual `/v0/auths/{auth_id}` and `/v0/costs/{cost_id}` endpoints.
It is simpler for the purposes of this guide to utilize this bulk endpoint, but
sometimes a bidder may prefer to edit their submission's constituent primitives
directly.
</Aside>

## Auctions

Auctions are explicitly triggered by an administrator. This allows the logic of
both when and how often to run an auction to be externalized elsewhere in the
market operator's systems.

Auctions consist of
1. Taking all bidders' submissions as-of a point in time,
2. Defining a duration (e.g. "now" to "now + 1 hour"),
3. Solving a mathematical optimization program and reporting the results.

The following command will run a single auction spanning the next hour:
```bash
curl -s -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWTADMIN" \
  --data '{ "by": "1h", "thru": "'"$(date --date="+1 hour" -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -v+1H -Iseconds 2>/dev/null)"'" }' \
  $API_SERVER/admin/auctions/solve
```

Running an auction may take a few moments, so unlike the other endpoints we
have interacted with, this endpoint *will not* return the auction results.
Instead, it should have responded with an `HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted` message,
which says the solve request was accepted and scheduled for processing.

To see the outcomes of these auctions once they are available, there are results endpoints available querying:
```bash
# Bidder 1's outcomes for each auction 
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWTB1" $API_SERVER/v0/auths/11111111-AAAA-8111-8111-111111111111/outcomes | jq .

# Bidder 2's outcomes for each auction
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWTB2" $API_SERVER/v0/auths/22222222-AAAA-8222-8222-222222222222/outcomes | jq .

# The demonstration product's outcomes for each auction
curl -s $API_SERVER/v0/products/$PRODUCT/outcomes | jq .
```

## Next Steps

For building a client, the OpenAPI schema (available at http://localhost:8080/rapidoc or wherever the server is running) lists all the available server endpoints.
The documentation available at https://docs.rs/fts-core/latest/fts_core is also a good starting point to learn more about the various operations the server implements.

For learning more about flow trading, it is recommended to read the guides on [auths](/concepts/auths) and [costs](/concepts/costs).
